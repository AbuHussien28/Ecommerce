# ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Windows Forms Application

During my journey at **Information Technology Institute (ITI),** I developed this **E-Commerce Windows Forms application** that interacts with a database using **ADO.NET**. The project follows a **three-layer architecture (DAL, BLL, PL)** to ensure separation of concerns and better performance.

## ðŸ“Œ Features  

ðŸ”¹ **User Authentication** (Signup/Login) with a welcome screen that directs users based on their role  
ðŸ”¹ **Role-Based Dashboard**:  
       **User Dashboard**: Browse all products, filter by category  
       **Admin Dashboard**: Manage users, products, and categories
ðŸ”¹ **Full CRUD Operations** for **Users, Categories, and Products**  
ðŸ”¹ **Smooth Navigation** between users, categories, and products for easy item addition and seamless transitions  
ðŸ”¹ **Profile Management** (Edit Profile, except role modification)  
ðŸ”¹ **Password Change System** with **old password validation and alerts**
